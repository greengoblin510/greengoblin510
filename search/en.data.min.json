I started growing when I was about 18 here in Michigan.\nI fell in love with all its medicinal properties. It has helped me and my family tremendously with anything from anxiety, eating, digestive problems, and an autoimmune disease called lupus. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say I have a very special connection to cannabis in all its forms. I have been growing all types of plants for 14 years along with my brother Jacob Brown.\nWe grow 100% organically without harsh chemicals or pesticides. We grow with all natural processes following what\u0026rsquo;s called KNF (Korean Natural Farming) and Jadam (An eco-friendly practice of pest management). Both Practices were created by Youngsang Cho. All of which are pre approved for USDA Organic Farming.\nThese Farming practice’s work with nature and help build healthy fertile soil for years to come. Instead of using harmful chemicals that build up and cause issues in water tables and wildlife around the runoff. I also do consultations on Plant issues particularly cannabis/hemp . As well as education and consultation on soil health and how to achieve it for maximum production of crops.\n Greenlantern710 Makes Nearly All Music Heard on Stream and In Videos Check His Work out HERE      Check Out The Blaque Out      The Blaque Out    Lantern And I Go LIVE On Twitch Playing Games And Talking Plants       new Twitch.Embed(\"twitch-embed\", { width: 854, height: 480, channel: \"greengoblin510\", // Only needed if this page is going to be embedded on other websites parent: [\"embed.example.com\", \"othersite.example.com\"] });   Sponsored By      Drops Of Balance       A Great way to ensure you and your plants arent mineral deficent!

Not using synthetic foaming and wetting agents help protect the waterways by not letting the synthetic soaps and foaming agents into those waterways. Not only the Jadam wetting agent breaks down naturally in the soil even though it’s not recommended to water indirectly but drips and drops falling of the plant from a foliar application is nothing to worry about.\nJadam wetting agent is great to use on its own to wash the plant occasionally. On its own, it can help prevent and get rid of a lot of soft-bodied insects. But mixed with other IPM products like essential oils, neem, JNP(Jadam Natural Pesticides) it increases its efficacy a ton and can help eradicate many infestations.\nI highly recommend making some Jadam wetting agent yourself and you\u0026rsquo;ll save a ton of money! I Have a video on making it yourself as well as you can get the awesome Book Jadam Organic Pest and Disease Control(Amazon Link).\nBut if you would like to support the channel and buy a bottle from us that is highly appreciated. These are 16oz bottles and used at 1oz per gallon once a week with your other IPM Or on its own should last around 16 weeks for a smaller gardener.\nApplication Rate: Dilute 1 to 4 ounces per gallon of Soft water like distilled and RO Water. Mix well. Foliar spray on plants.\nIngredients: Distilled water, canola oil, potassium hydroxide\nAll credit for this recipe goes to JADAM. If it was not for them, these ultra-low-cost farming practices would not be available and so widespread.\n "},{"id":9,"href":"/soldoutJWA/","title":"JWA Sold Out","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":"Sorry The JWA is Currently Sold Out     "},{"id":10,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":""},{"id":11,"href":"/goblins-World/","title":"Goblins World","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":""},{"id":12,"href":"/goblins-World/recent-vids/recent-vids/","title":"Recent vids","parent":"Goblins World","content":"goblins world\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/Recommended-Products/","title":"Recommended Products","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":""},{"id":14,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Enviroment/","title":"Enviroment","parent":"Recommended Products","content":""},{"id":15,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Enviroment/Enviromental-Control/","title":"Enviromental Control","parent":"Enviroment","content":"Dehumidifer     Humdifier     "},{"id":16,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Enviroment/Fans/","title":"Fans","parent":"Enviroment","content":"inline fans     Wall Fans     Floor Fans     "},{"id":17,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Propagation/","title":"Propagation","parent":"Recommended Products","content":"sdf\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Enviroment/tents/tents/","title":"Tents","parent":"Enviroment","content":"sdf\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Nutritional/","title":"Nutritional","parent":"Recommended Products","content":""},{"id":20,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Nutritional/amendments/","title":"Amendments","parent":"Nutritional","content":"asdf\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Gentics/","title":"Gentics","parent":"Recommended Products","content":" Soild Gentics   Lumber Jack Seed Source https://www.lumberjackseedsource.com/\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/tags/Minerals/","title":"Minerals","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":23,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Nutritional/minerals/","title":"Minerals","parent":"Nutritional","content":"  8oz Drops of Balance\nDropsofBalance® is a unique formulation of concentrated, naturally occurring ionic mineral salts neutralizes and assists in the reduction of over 250 contaminants.
