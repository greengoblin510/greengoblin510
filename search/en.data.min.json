I started growing when I was about 18 here in Michigan.\nI fell in love with all its medicinal properties. It has helped me and my family tremendously with anything from anxiety, eating, digestive problems, and an autoimmune disease called lupus. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say I have a very special connection to cannabis in all its forms. I have been growing all types of plants for 14 years along with my brother Jacob Brown.\nWe grow 100% organically without harsh chemicals or pesticides. We grow with all natural processes following what\u0026rsquo;s called KNF (Korean Natural Farming) and Jadam (An eco-friendly practice of pest management). Both Practices were created by Youngsang Cho. All of which are pre approved for USDA Organic Farming.\nThese Farming practice’s work with nature and help build healthy fertile soil for years to come. Instead of using harmful chemicals that build up and cause issues in water tables and wildlife around the runoff. I also do consultations on Plant issues particularly cannabis/hemp . As well as education and consultation on soil health and how to achieve it for maximum production of crops.\n Greenlantern710 Makes Nearly All Music Heard on Stream and In Videos Check His Work out HERE      Check Out The Blaque Out      The Blaque Out    Lantern And I Go LIVE On Twitch Playing Games And Talking Plants       new Twitch.Embed(\"twitch-embed\", { width: 854, height: 480, channel: \"greengoblin510\", // Only needed if this page is going to be embedded on other websites parent: [\"embed.example.com\", \"othersite.example.com\"] });   Sponsored By      Drops Of Balance       A Great way to ensure you and your plants arent mineral deficent!

Not using synthetic foaming and wetting agents help protect the waterways by not letting the synthetic soaps and foaming agents into those waterways. Not only the Jadam wetting agent breaks down naturally in the soil even though it’s not recommended to water indirectly but drips and drops falling of the plant from a foliar application is nothing to worry about.\nJadam wetting agent is great to use on its own to wash the plant occasionally. On its own, it can help prevent and get rid of a lot of soft-bodied insects. But mixed with other IPM products like essential oils, neem, JNP(Jadam Natural Pesticides) it increases its efficacy a ton and can help eradicate many infestations.\nI highly recommend making some Jadam wetting agent yourself and you\u0026rsquo;ll save a ton of money! I Have a video on making it yourself as well as you can get the awesome Book Jadam Organic Pest and Disease Control(Amazon Link).\nBut if you would like to support the channel and buy a bottle from us that is highly appreciated. These are 16oz bottles and used at 1oz per gallon once a week with your other IPM Or on its own should last around 16 weeks for a smaller gardener.\nApplication Rate: Dilute 1 to 4 ounces per gallon of Soft water like distilled and RO Water. Mix well. Foliar spray on plants.\nIngredients: Distilled water, canola oil, potassium hydroxide\nAll credit for this recipe goes to JADAM. If it was not for them, these ultra-low-cost farming practices would not be available and so widespread.\n "},{"id":8,"href":"/soldoutJWA/","title":"JWA Sold Out","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":"Sorry The JWA is Currently Sold Out     "},{"id":9,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":""},{"id":10,"href":"/goblins-World/","title":"Goblins World","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":""},{"id":11,"href":"/goblins-World/recent-vids/recent-vids/","title":"Recent vids","parent":"Goblins World","content":"goblins world\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/natural-Farming/","title":"Natural Farming","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":""},{"id":13,"href":"/tags/Actinomycetes/","title":"Actinomycetes","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":14,"href":"/natural-Farming/EM-1/","title":"EM-1","parent":"Natural Farming","content":"Development of EM     EM-1® is a Microbial Inoculant Containing LABS, PNSB, Yeasts, And Actinomycetes. All of which are great for soil, plants, and many animals and even Ourselves . EM-1 Is considered a Probiotic and was discovered by DR. TERUO HIGA in Okinawa, Japan During His Studies At University. The Story is one to keep in mind when growing and experimenting with Natural Farming Methods. He went to school to get his Doctorate in Horticulture while studying he was working Farming Oranges and during that time they used heavily chemicals for pestisides and nutrients. After a while working on the Orange Farm he developed some rashes and his over all health declined! This made him even more interested in Microbiology so he moved away from working out at the Farm and dove into researching Microbiology. At the time most people where researching One Micro Organism at a time and you can deduce that it was a slow and tedious process. So Dr. Teruo started collecting and researching more than one strain/type of Microorganism symotanously . While doing many experiments he felt like he was wasting many of these Micro organismims when disposing of them so he decided to sprinkle them out on a small patch of grass outside. About a week later he notice that patch of grass grew extremely well this brought him to the realization that it was a combination of micro organisms that provided the boost in growth. After Many More Experiments in 1980 he found the most effective micoorganisms(R) for growth and Called them EM! Now what\u0026rsquo;s so interesting about this story and many others is that the awesome break through was by accident or chance and not by well planed and worked out experiments! Like I\u0026rsquo;ve said before this is an awesome time to be into soil science and microbiology because now we are starting to develop instruments and tests to explain and educated us further on how these natural processes work and interact with Plants and the environment!\nEM is an amazing technology with experiments conducted all over the world over showing that it can:      Activate soil life Promote plant life Improve Nutrient uptake Suppress harmful microbes Restore water quality Activate compost Control odor Bio-activate septic tank systems Control compost Temp Promote Health in Live Stock Help Mitigate Heavy Metals And Much More  Now you can use EM-1 Directly Or You Can Activate and Expand It. Using it Directly is simple mix 1oz per gallon into non chlorinated water and water into soil or put it in a sprayer and foliar feed it! Now If you want to Activate it and get a bit more EM-1 For your money all your going to need is\n clean water non sulfured molasses fermentation container (Pop bottle, Juice Bottle, etc)  Now the Container needs to be flexible so it can expand during the Fermentation process. The Process will create a decent amount of Co2 gas but don\u0026rsquo;t worry after a bit the PNSB with processes the Co2 Into back into Oxygen and the pressure will reduce.\nTo Extend the EM:\n 1 part EM 1 part Molasses 20 parts Water 1 tsp Super Cera Powder (a bioceramic powder) or Sea Salt  Culture the mixture in an airtight container - it should be an anaerobic condition. pH should drop within 7-10 days to below pH 4 (ideally pH 3.5).\nuse cheap PH test Strips to test the PH. Keep in mind you may have to use a Digital PH Pen If your Color Blind.\nGet your Self a bottle of EM-1 Expand it and Use it its great for Plant health and Nothing will show you more than seeing results for your self. Now a few other things you can use EM-1 For are\n add 1oz Activated EM-1 to your compost tea after its brewed and right before application. Cleaning a Spot were a pet had and accident to eliminate the order putting some in a spray bottle and spray the trash to eliminate odors and help keep fly\u0026rsquo;s away clear up algae blooms in water ways and ponds  and people keep finding ingenious ways to use it to solve everyday problems.

They all work together to create health giving benefits to both humans and plants. The main active chemical constituents of Aloe vera are: amino acids, anthraquinones, enzymes, minerals, vitamins, lignins, monosaccharide, polysaccharides, salicylic acid, saponins, and sterols.\nAmino Acids     Aloe Has many amino acids including\n isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine valine tryptophan  Some of the other non-essential amino acids found in Aloe vera include alanine, arginine, asparagine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, proline, serine, tyrosine, glutamine, and aspartic acid.\nThe most important anthraquinones are aloin and emodin. They are anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and analgesic.\nEnzymes     The main enzymes found in Aloe vera include Amylase (breaks down sugars and starches), Bradykinase (stimulates immune system, analgesic, anti-inflammatory), Catalase (prevents accumulation of water in the body), Cellulase (aids digestion - cellulose), Lipase (aids digestion - fats), Oxidase, Alkaline Phosphatase, Proteolytiase (hydrolyses proteins into their constituent elements), Creatine Phosphokinase (aids metabolism), and Carboxypeptidase.\nVitamins And Minerals      It also contains Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12 along with choline, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, and chromium\n Additional minerals found in Aloe vera include copper , iron , potassium , phosphorus, and sodium. Salicylic Acid     Aloe vera contains salicylic acid which is an aspirin-like compound with anti -inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-bacterial properties. It has anti-pyretic properties for reducing fevers. Other constituents of Aloe vera would include prostaglandins, tannins, magnesium lactate, resins, mannins, proteins such as lectins, monosulfonic acid and gibberlin.\nAloe has Salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is involved in local and systemic plant defense responses against pathogens Aka SARS. It plays a role during stresses such as drought, chilling, heavy metal toxicity, heat, and osmotic stress. SA can volatilize and warn neighboring plants of attack.\nSaponins     Another constituent of Aloe vera includes saponins. These are soapy substances from the gel that is capable of cleansing and having antiseptic properties. The saponins perform strongly as anti-microbial against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and yeasts. The plant sterols or phyto-steroids in Aloe vera include Cholesterol, Campesterol, Lupeol, and B (Beta sign) Sitosterol. The plant steroids have fatty acids in them that have antiseptic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties\n Aloes Use In The Garden     Germination     \rThe Hormones, vitimans, minerals and anti-microbial properties Helps get the seedling off to a good start!  Propagation     \rThe Hormones, vitimans, minerals and anti-microbial properties helps rooting to take place while protecting the cutting.
