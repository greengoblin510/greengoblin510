I started growing when I was about 18 here in Michigan.\nI fell in love with all its medicinal properties. It has helped me and my family tremendously with anything from anxiety, eating, digestive problems, and an autoimmune disease called lupus. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say I have a very special connection to cannabis in all its forms. I have been growing all types of plants for 14 years along with my brother Jacob Brown.\nWe grow 100% organically without harsh chemicals or pesticides. We grow with all natural processes following what\u0026rsquo;s called KNF (Korean Natural Farming) and Jadam (An eco-friendly practice of pest management). Both Practices were created by Youngsang Cho. All of which are pre approved for USDA Organic Farming.\nThese Farming practice’s work with nature and help build healthy fertile soil for years to come. Instead of using harmful chemicals that build up and cause issues in water tables and wildlife around the runoff. I also do consultations on Plant issues particularly cannabis/hemp . As well as education and consultation on soil health and how to achieve it for maximum production of crops.\n Greenlantern710 Makes Nearly All Music Heard on Stream and In Videos Check His Work out HERE      Check Out The Blaque Out      The Blaque Out    Lantern And I Go LIVE On Twitch Playing Games And Talking Plants       new Twitch.Embed(\"twitch-embed\", { width: 854, height: 480, channel: \"greengoblin510\", // Only needed if this page is going to be embedded on other websites parent: [\"embed.example.com\", \"othersite.example.com\"] });   Sponsored By      Drops Of Balance       A Great way to ensure you and your plants arent mineral deficent!

All of which are great for soil, plants, and many animals and even Ourselves . EM-1 Is considered a Probiotic and was discovered by DR. TERUO HIGA in Okinawa, Japan During His Studies At University. The Story is one to keep in mind when growing and experimenting with Natural Farming Methods. He went to school to get his Doctorate in Horticulture while studying he was working Farming Oranges and during that time they used heavily chemicals for pestisides and nutrients. After a while working on the Orange Farm he developed some rashes and his over all health declined! This made him even more interested in Microbiology so he moved away from working out at the Farm and dove into researching Microbiology. At the time most people where researching One Micro Organism at a time and you can deduce that it was a slow and tedious process. So Dr. Teruo started collecting and researching more than one strain/type of Microorganism symotanously . While doing many experiments he felt like he was wasting many of these Micro organismims when disposing of them so he decided to sprinkle them out on a small patch of grass outside. About a week later he notice that patch of grass grew extremely well this brought him to the realization that it was a combination of micro organisms that provided the boost in growth. After Many More Experiments in 1980 he found the most effective micoorganisms(R) for growth and Called them EM! Now what\u0026rsquo;s so interesting about this story and many others is that the awesome break through was by accident or chance and not by well planed and worked out experiments! Like I\u0026rsquo;ve said before this is an awesome time to be into soil science and microbiology because now we are starting to develop instruments and tests to explain and educated us further on how these natural processes work and interact with Plants and the environment!\nEM is an amazing technology with experiments conducted all over the world over showing that it can:      Activate soil life Promote plant life Improve Nutrient uptake Suppress harmful microbes Restore water quality Activate compost Control odor Bio-activate septic tank systems Control compost Temp Promote Health in Live Stock Help Mitigate Heavy Metals And Much More  Now you can use EM-1 Directly Or You Can Activate and Expand It. Using it Directly is simple mix 1oz per gallon into non chlorinated water and water into soil or put it in a sprayer and foliar feed it! Now If you want to Activate it and get a bit more EM-1 For your money all your going to need is\n clean water non sulfured molasses fermentation container (Pop bottle, Juice Bottle, etc)  Now the Container needs to be flexible so it can expand during the Fermentation process. The Process will create a decent amount of Co2 gas but don\u0026rsquo;t worry after a bit the PNSB with processes the Co2 Into back into Oxygen and the pressure will reduce.\nTo Extend the EM:\n 1 part EM 1 part Molasses 20 parts Water 1 tsp Super Cera Powder (a bioceramic powder) or Sea Salt  Culture the mixture in an airtight container - it should be an anaerobic condition. pH should drop within 7-10 days to below pH 4 (ideally pH 3.5).\nuse cheap PH test Strips to test the PH. Keep in mind you may have to use a Digital PH Pen If your Color Blind.\nGet your Self a bottle of EM-1 Expand it and Use it its great for Plant health and Nothing will show you more than seeing results for your self. Now a few other things you can use EM-1 For are\n add 1oz Activated EM-1 to your compost tea after its brewed and right before application. Cleaning a Spot were a pet had and accident to eliminate the order putting some in a spray bottle and spray the trash to eliminate odors and help keep fly\u0026rsquo;s away clear up algae blooms in water ways and ponds  and people keep finding ingenious ways to use it to solve everyday problems.

Alfalfa is also called Lucerne in most places outside of north America and is cultivated for a multitude of uses from grazing animal feed, hay, mulch, cover crop and green manure. Alfalfa is a perennial that closely resembles clover until the plant is more mature. It grows 1 - 3 feet tall and is native to warmer temperate climates. Alfalfa has been used since the ancient Greek and Roman Era\u0026rsquo;s.\nGrowing Alafia is great for many reasons its a great food source for animals and people. Alfalfa sprouts are a great microgreen if your into microgreens.\n\nIts a great cover crop for planting in-between crops to keep that soil alive by pumping plant exudates into the ground as well as feeding local wildlife like rabbits. Alfalfa is a nitrogen Fixing crop using Rhizobium nodules. Bringing down cost of fertilizer by fixing nitrogen from the air into the soil so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to apply as much or any fertizler when you have a complete permaculture system.\n\nThen when you chop the cover crop it can be bailed up for storage for grazing animals during the winter months as well mulch.\n\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t forget its also great at feeding the soil when top dressed as meal or mulch. Especially in the winter months for those who get freezing temps it can help protect your soil with a decent layer of mulch.\n While getting all these uses from Alfalfa if you allow some to flower out they\u0026rsquo;re great for pollinators.\nWhat does Alfalfa Contain     Alfalfa much like kelp is a rich source of proteins, minerals (calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, copper, selenium, organic silicon, manganese), vitamins (C, K, D, E, U, provitamin A, B1, B2, B6, B12, folic acid/B9, biotin, niacin), as well as β-carotene and eight essential amino acids (alanine, lysine, arginine, histidine, cysteine, proline, methionine, tyrosine).\nAlfalfa normally has a NPK ratio of 3-1-2 a bit more or less depending on where it was grown and brand. So it has a little of everything but more Nitrogen great for young plants.\nOne of the most talked about properties of alfalfa is triacontanol which is a natural plant growth hormone. Which increases a plants effectiveness to photosynthesize and promotes roots and shoots. So alfalfa is great to use during the vegetative growth period with its high nitrogen content and natural plant growth hormones and trace minerals.\nUsing alfalfa in the garden     Compost activator/accelerator - it having a high nitrogen content can help compost piles get going if they are decomposing a little slow.\nTop dressing - You can top dress or directly mix into your soil and is in many dry amendment blends.\nTeas - add it to your compost teas but don\u0026rsquo;t add too much a little goes a long way 1/4 cup per 5 gallon batch of tea. You can also make a tea of just alfalfa but letting 1/4 cup soak in a 5 gallon bucket for a day or two just stir once in a while.\nseed spout tea - seed spout teas are great and contain tons of enzymes and natural growth hormones.\nFerments - you can ferment it by its-self or with a few other plants to make a balanced plant tonic\nResources: Apostol, Livia \u0026amp; Iorga, Sorin \u0026amp; Mosoiu, Claudia \u0026amp; Racovita, Radu \u0026amp; Niculae, Oana \u0026amp; Vlasceanu, Gabriela.

They all work together to create health giving benefits to both humans and plants. The main active chemical constituents of Aloe vera are: amino acids, anthraquinones, enzymes, minerals, vitamins, lignins, monosaccharide, polysaccharides, salicylic acid, saponins, and sterols.\nAmino Acids     Aloe Has many amino acids including\n isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine valine tryptophan  Some of the other non-essential amino acids found in Aloe vera include alanine, arginine, asparagine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, proline, serine, tyrosine, glutamine, and aspartic acid.\nThe most important anthraquinones are aloin and emodin. They are anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and analgesic.\nEnzymes     The main enzymes found in Aloe vera include Amylase (breaks down sugars and starches), Bradykinase (stimulates immune system, analgesic, anti-inflammatory), Catalase (prevents accumulation of water in the body), Cellulase (aids digestion - cellulose), Lipase (aids digestion - fats), Oxidase, Alkaline Phosphatase, Proteolytiase (hydrolyses proteins into their constituent elements), Creatine Phosphokinase (aids metabolism), and Carboxypeptidase.\nVitamins And Minerals      It also contains Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12 along with choline, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, and chromium\n Additional minerals found in Aloe vera include copper , iron , potassium , phosphorus, and sodium. Salicylic Acid     Aloe vera contains salicylic acid which is an aspirin-like compound with anti -inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-bacterial properties. It has anti-pyretic properties for reducing fevers. Other constituents of Aloe vera would include prostaglandins, tannins, magnesium lactate, resins, mannins, proteins such as lectins, monosulfonic acid and gibberlin.\nAloe has Salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is involved in local and systemic plant defense responses against pathogens Aka SARS. It plays a role during stresses such as drought, chilling, heavy metal toxicity, heat, and osmotic stress. SA can volatilize and warn neighboring plants of attack.\nSaponins     Another constituent of Aloe vera includes saponins. These are soapy substances from the gel that is capable of cleansing and having antiseptic properties. The saponins perform strongly as anti-microbial against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and yeasts. The plant sterols or phyto-steroids in Aloe vera include Cholesterol, Campesterol, Lupeol, and B (Beta sign) Sitosterol. The plant steroids have fatty acids in them that have antiseptic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties\n Aloes Use In The Garden     Germination     \rThe Hormones, vitimans, minerals and anti-microbial properties Helps get the seedling off to a good start!  Propagation     \rThe Hormones, vitimans, minerals and anti-microbial properties helps rooting to take place while protecting the cutting.

Kelp adsorbs nutrients much like fungi do by direct adsorption!\n Kelp is a wonderful dynamic accumulator of nutrients. It accomplishes this by attaching its self to the ocean floor usually on something heavy like a rock via the holdfast(A root like structure). Then grows blade like leaves and these little gas bladders that create Buoyancy. So in combination of the holdfast holding the kelp to the ocean floor and the and the gas bladder creating buoyancy the kelp remains vertical. allowing it to grow to the surface and increase its photosynthetic efficacy. Using the energy from the sun kelp adsorbs nutrients from the nutrient dense water its in. Accumulating nearly all nutrients and minerals around it. Making it a great addition to our soils!\n These little gas bladders hold the kelp vertical   Whats In Kelp      Kelp In the Garden     Kelp Meal is a Powerful natural fertilizer that has many things that plants and soils thrive on. it comes in three main forms kelp meal, liquid kelp, and granulated.\nKelp Meal is Kelp that has been harvested, dried, and chopped up finely. This is my preferred form of kelp\nLiquid Kelp is cold press or fermented/ digested products. both can be great for foliar or soil drench\nGranulated is an extract rich in potassium as potassium oxide carful with this you can add to much if you use it and I like to stay away from extracts like this in pure form and take the approach of whole plant or whole nutriments\nResources:     https://www.seaweed.ie/nutrition/index.php\nhttps://buildasoil.com/blogs/news/11759569-diy-instant-kelp-meal-tea-coots-hydrated-kelp-meal-trick\nStructure of Kelp https://sites.gsu.edu/upatel17/2019/04/10/chapter-2-kelp-structure/\nCo2 Sequestration https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/how-kelp-naturally-combats-global-climate-change/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp\nmaxicrop-kelp-analysis.pdf\nAppleby-Jones_Stephanie_MASTERS_2014.pdf\nBooks     http://www.amazon.com/Seaweed-Plant-Growth-T-Senn/dp/0939241013\nhttps://amzn.to/3e4kuaC\nhttp://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/seaweed.html\n"},{"id":51,"href":"/Amendment-Of-The-Week/posts/Neem-The-Village-Phamacy/","title":"Neem The Tree That solves Global Problems","parent":"Amendment of the Week","content":"Neem\u0026rsquo;s Origin:      Neem   Neem is another one of natures gifts that is mainly cultivated in the subcontinente of India. Neem is a member of mahogany family Meliaceae. Its Also know as the botanical name Azadriachta indica\nNeem has been used for thousands of years by humans for a multitude of things including\n Skin Conditions like zits, eczema, psoriasis. mouth care with teeth cleanings and mouth wash\u0026rsquo;s. anti fungal uses like washes for athletes foot, and ring worm. dandruff.  And many more uses. So many that books have been written covering the benefits of neem and all its products for human and animal use.\nNeem Tree can provide animal feed to help their immune system. As well as a wash for skin issues!\nEvery part of the neem tree can be used for one application or another it is so expansive.\nThe latinized name of neem, Azadirachta indica, is derived from the Persian. Azad means “free”; dirakht means “tree”; indica-Hind means “of Indian origin”. Hence it literally means “the free tree of India”1.\nThe neem tree is an incredible plant that has been declared the “Tree of the 21st century” by the United Nations2.\nThe US National Academy of Science published a report in 1992 entitled “Neem: A tree for solving global problems”3.\nWhat Neem Contains     Biochemical     These biochemical components include azadirachtin, nimbolinin, nimbin, nimbidin, nimbidol, nimbanene, nimbandiol, nimbolide, sodium nimbinate, gedunin, salannin, quercetin, 6-desacetylnimbinene, ascorbic acid, n-hexacosanol and amino acid, 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione, 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, 17-hydroxyazadiradione, ß-sitosterol, and polyphenolic flavonoids.\nAmong The Most studied Azadirachtin\nAzadirachtin is similar to Neem Oil in that it is derived from the seeds of the neem tree (Azadirachta indica), but lacks the fungicidal properties of neem oil. Initially found to inhibit desert locust feeding, Azadirachtin is now known to affect a broad spectrum of over 200 insect species including Aphids, Mealybugs, Caterpillars, Japanese Beetle, Whiteflies, Mites, Root Aphids and Thrips. Azadirachtin\u0026rsquo;s primary mode of action is as an anti-feedant, but it also disrupts normal insect growth/molting, repels larvae and adults, sterilizes adults and deters egg laying.\nAzadirachtin products can be preferred by some due to their compatibility with a wide range of Insecticides and Biocontrols, such as the beneficial fungus Beauveria bassiana. With no re-entry restrictions Azadirachtin allows for use in a variety of settings and breaks down rapidly after application, minimizing unwanted effects on the environment. Alternating Azadirachtin applications with other insecticides provides variable control with less risk of insects developing resistance.\nNPK     nitrogen 2-3%, phosphorus 1% and potassium 1.4%. It also contains 1.0-1.5% tannic acid and has the highest sulphur content of 1.07 – 1.36% among the oil cakes.\nAmino Acids      Amino acids   Fatty Acids     Fatty acids composition: The fatty acid composition (table-4) shows the presence of nine fatty acids, including four major ones. These are oleic acid (41.91±0.69%), followed by linoleic acid (19.59±0.44%), stearic acid (18.71±0.46%) and palmitic acid (15.59±0.27%). This high linoleic and oleic acid proportion is noted in Jatropha oil23. The fatty acid profile is comparable to those presented in the literature20,9. Indeed, the ratio unsaturated/saturated fatty acids, being at about 60%, confirms the unsaturated behavour of the oil.\nMinerals      Amino acids   https://neemfoundation.org/about-neem/chemistry-of-neem/\nhttps://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO200023443161204.pdf\nhttp://isca.in/rjcs/Archives/v5/i7/10.ISCA-RJCS-2015-097.pdf\nhttps://neempedia.com/neem-cake/\nUsing Neem In The Garden     Different Forms Of Neem:     Neem Cake:      Neem Cake   Neem Cake has a bit of Neem Oil Left in it from the cold pressing of the neem seed therefore has more of the active ingredients in it for pest prevention.\nNeem Meal:      Neem Meal   Neem Meal is great as an soil amendment but does have less of the active ingredients if you were going to make a decoctions or liquid spray for pests. This is because Neem Meal is is neem cake that has been striped of most the oils with and alcohol wash.\nNeem Oil:      Neem Oil   Neem oil is best when cold pressed from the neem seed allowing for the least amount of break down of all the great things that are in a neem seed. I use Neem Seed Oil for pest and disease resistance during vegetative growth. I only spray when absolutely needed in bloom with a Jadam wetting agent or Organisheild which degrade much faster that the active ingredients in Neem oil.\nGrowing Neem     Neem trees aren\u0026rsquo;t hard to grow they tolerate wide ranges of temperature\u0026rsquo;s and grow fast. unfortunately they don\u0026rsquo;t like freezing Temps for long period of time. If they freeze they will shed all their leaves. They are a great tree to consider for a canopy tree in a permaculture food forest providing many benefits along with a great wind block especially when your in a more temperate climate that doesn\u0026rsquo;t freeze.\nGreat Example Of Growing Neem In The U.S.     \rMore Info On Growing Neem     \rWhere to get Neem\nhttps://buildasoil.com/products/neem-oil-organic-from-india\nhttps://buildasoil.com/products/neem-cake-west-coast-horticulture?_pos=3\u0026_sid=59fce9325\u0026_ss=r\nNeem Leaf Great For Worm Bins https://buildasoil.com/products/neem-leaf-powder?_pos=2\u0026_sid=59fce9325\u0026_ss=r\nResources     Neem Has Been Used For thousands Of Years : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695574/\nGreat Books:\nhttps://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/1924/neem-a-tree-for-solving-global-problems\n"},{"id":52,"href":"/recent-vids/","title":"Recent-vids","parent":"Welcome Green Gang","content":""},{"id":53,"href":"/Recommended-Products/Lights/lightcode/","title":"Lightcode","parent":"Recommended Products","content":"GG510 "}]
