      <description>JWA - Jadam Wetting Agent      Lantern And Goblin   Jadam Wetting agent is a natural emulsifier and wetting agent that breaks down completely in 72hrs. Not using synthetic foaming and wetting agents help protect the waterways by not letting the synthetic soaps and foaming agents into those waterways. Not only the Jadam wetting agent breaks down naturally in the soil even though it’s not recommended to water indirectly but drips and drops falling of the plant from a foliar application is nothing to worry about.</description>
